Test 0 - Home stepper
Reset -> 
Stepper homes
DC motor stays on
LCD output correct
Pause  button not working

SUCCESS

Test 1 - Scan and stop works correctly, does not output value
Reset
Stepper homes
Display doesn't clear
Aluminum goes through
Didn't clear display

4th attempt was a SUCCESS
Outputted 20 for an aluminum part and 960 for a black part
- ADC is working correctly
- 10 bit is working correctly
- Reflective stage is working correctly 

Test 2
LCD displays active
Stepper homes
DC motor turns on
Pause displays pause
Button can be pushed over and over toggling the LCD

SUCCESS

Test 3



SUCCESS

Notes:
 - Asked exactly what we actually need the magnetic stage for if we can sort without it
 ANS: 
 - don't need it

 Test 5
 Tried twice on Monday, some good and bad. The ADC is verified again after some back and forth, 
 with some pause functionality and displaying the number of links left it sort of worked when 4 pieces 
 were loaded on at a time. The DC motor stop speed was increased so that parts would not fly off and it was
 advised to stop the motor as soon as the interrupt triggers. 

 If only one part is loaded at a time the belt sometimes wouldn't stop at all on Simons board, which is strange, 
 or it stops and starts right away. Before Simon's apparatus we used one with delays on with Kurt's board and it was working somewhat,
 All ADC values were correct, the linked list may have been lagging, but it seemed like it all worked, but then on Simon's that was not the case

5 - Combined Functionality
Attempt 1
With Kurt, gave some advice on how to better structure ISRs

Attempt 2
  Testing with Simon
  Parts always categorizing correctly
  Some parts sorting correctly, some not
  Hypothesis: the ISR is skipping some parts because the stepper has to move while the ISR is not triggered yet

Attempt 3
  New Testing w/ Patrick :) Much more helpful
  White and steel are correct
  Black dumps into steel
  Retry
  White works
  Steel works
  Black dumps into steel
  Aluminum dumps into steel
  
  With all four samples at once it sorts some but not all

  Attempt 4
  After homing, four step correct 4 steps counter clockwise

  The stepper is dying
  The lights are going off when it tries sorting

  Aluminum works after homing
  Steel from aluminum does not works
  Black to white, white to black works
  Black to aluminum works
  Aluminum to white messes up
  CCW to steel from black messes up


6 - Sorting Finalization

Attempt 1
  Pieces stop at bucket stage

Attempt 2
  Pieces stop at bucket stage still

Attempt 3
  Changed if statement in bucket stage
  Moved DC_Start() outside if statement 
  Pieces kinda sorted but at some point they all got dumped without any sorting

Attempt 4
  Changed INT4 (pause button) to rising edge (unrelated, just good to note)
  Added ADC prescaler
  Pieces almost sorted
  Swapped bucket_psn for aluminum and steel
  Pieces sort perfectly
