 Test 5
 Tried twice on Monday, some good and bad. The ADC is verified again after some back and forth, 
 with some pause functionality and displaying the number of links left it sort of worked when 4 pieces 
 were loaded on at a time. The DC motor stop speed was increased so that parts would not fly off and it was
 advised to stop the motor as soon as the interrupt triggers. 

 If only one part is loaded at a time the belt sometimes wouldn't stop at all on Simons board, which is strange, 
 or it stops and starts right away. Before Simon's apparatus we used one with delays on with Kurt's board and it was working somewhat,
 All ADC values were correct, the linked list may have been lagging, but it seemed like it all worked, but then on Simon's that was not the case
