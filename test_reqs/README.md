# Test Requests

## Workflow

Create a subfolder for each test request made to the MECH458 Lab. In each subfolder, copy the hex file over from the main source and import the test request document. You can commit these changes to the related feature branch.
Note: The test request folder will only be available on that branch until it is merged with the main branch.
