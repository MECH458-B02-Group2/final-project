Connections:

PortB = DC motor As per Lab - PORTB.3 to IA, PORTB.2 to IB, PORTB.1 to EA, and PORTB.0 to EB
PortC = LCD/LEDs

PE4 = Pause/Resume Button (Active Lo)

--------------------------  Above PORT assignments are to stream line Project Testing  -----------------------------------

Instructions: Pause Functionality

  - Press RESET on MCU

  - LCD: ACTIVE
  - LCD: HOMING...
  - Stepper homes
  - LCD: ACTIVE
  - DC Motor ON
  - Put one part on belt
  - LCD will display ADC value
  - Correct material displayed on the LCD
  - Stepper rotates to the correct position
  - DC motor turns on 
  - Repeat for all 4 types of parts - motor should not turn off for Black

  
  - toggling Pause Button (INT4, PE4) will toggle DC Motor ON/OFF 
    and display to ACTIVE/PAUSE

  END OF TEST
5 - Combined Functionality
Attempt 1
With Kurt, gave some advice on how to better structure ISRs

Attempt 2
  Testing with Simon
  Parts always categorizing correctly
  Some parts sorting correctly, some not
  Hypothesis: the ISR is skipping some parts because the stepper has to move while the ISR is not triggered yet

Attempt 3
  New Testing w/ Patrick :) Much more helpful
  White and steel are correct
  Black dumps into steel
  Retry
  White works
  Steel works
  Black dumps into steel
  Aluminum dumps into steel
  
  With all four samples at once it sorts some but not all

  Attempt 4
  After homing, four step correct 4 steps counter clockwise

  The stepper is dying
  The lights are going off when it tries sorting

  Aluminum works after homing
  Steel from aluminum does not works
  Black to white, white to black works
  Black to aluminum works
  Aluminum to white messes up
  CCW to steel from black messes up
